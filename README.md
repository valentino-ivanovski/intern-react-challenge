# Business Card React App

This project is a simple React application that displays a business card styled box in the center of the screen.

## How I built it:

1. Imported a component from a UI library called Aceternity UI to make the card have a 3D depth effect when hovered over it. (I hope UI libraries are allowed)
2. Filled in the card with basic information and added a picture. After that I tried chosing a good looking size and layout for the content inside of the card. Inspiration in regards to this was taken from the Arc browser and their user id cards.
3. After I was happy with the arrangement, I went searching for a good background animation. I wanted to use Tailwind CSS for this, but I kept having errors with my 3D card effect, so I abandoned it and went with normal CSS.
4. I initially set a gradient as a background, similar to my Soundshift project, and thought adding an intro text fade animation would be cool. I made this possible with a timer that changes a variable after the 4 seconds fade out animation. This variable is responsible for displaying the intro text.
5. Once the background was chosen, I went ahead and styled the card. I looked for inspiration on leapwize.de, and I really liked the "Work with us" button style, so I based my entire card off it. I just added more depth to the card by scaling each component.
6. Once the design was done, I was just looking for smaller details like the hover animations and such. The goal was to make the card simple but fun looking.
